### Dockerized flask app

1. Directory `models` will be mounted as a volume during build process
2. Model is a showcase from: https://github.com/Alisa-lisa/conferences/tree/master/EP_2018 (ideally should not be part of the code)
3. Structure is the same as in existing flask app

How to run:

start `make run` from the root directory
